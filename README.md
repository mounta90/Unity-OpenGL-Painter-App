# Computer Graphics - HW1

## Instructions

- The instructions to use the painter program are simple due to the toolbox.
- For the "straight line" mode, a left mouse click creates the initial point; then a right mouse click creates the end point.

## Minor Program Issues

- The toolbox seems to be shifted to the left by a small amount; no idea why.
- The rotated polygon is not drawn in the center of the mouse click.
